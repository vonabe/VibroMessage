Firebase Vibration Messaging App
This Android app enables users to send and receive vibration messages with each other using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). The app operates in the background, allowing users to receive vibration messages even when the app is closed. Each message triggers a custom vibration pattern on the recipient's device, offering a unique and interactive way to communicate.

Features:
Send vibration messages between users via FCM.
Receive and process messages in the background.
Customizable vibration patterns for unique notifications.
